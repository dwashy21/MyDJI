<h1>DJI Hardware Product Terms of Use</h1>
<div class="content"><br>
    Thank you for your interest in this unmanned aerial system (UAS), together with its accessories (the “Product”) offered by SZ DJI Technology Co., Ltd. (“DJI”).  Please read the following terms and conditions carefully. By activating this product via DJI Go or DJI Go 4 application and tapping “I Agree” on this page, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (the “Product Terms”), the DJI Go application Terms (http://djistatic.com/agreement/dji-go-tos.html) (or the DJI Go 4 application Terms, available at http://djistatic.com/agreement/dji-go-4-tos.html), the DJI Store Terms of Sale (http://www.dji.com/terms), and the DJI Privacy Policy (http://www.dji.com/policy) (together, these “Terms”). If you are not eligible or do not agree to any of the Terms, then you may not use the Product. You may be entitled to a full refund of your purchase of the Product if you return the inactivated Product within seven (7) days in accordance with the DJI Refund and Replacement Policy (http://www.dji.com/service).<br>



    To access certain features of the Product, you must use the DJI GO or the DJI GO 4 application to control the Product.  You might be required to login to such apps with your DJI account.<br>



    Subject to the country specific provisions below, these Terms provide that all disputes between you and DJI will be resolved by BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights under these Terms, except for matters that may be taken to small claims court. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury, and your claims cannot be brought as a class action. Please review Section 10 (“Dispute Resolution and Arbitration”) of these Terms for the details regarding your agreement to arbitrate any disputes with DJI.<br>



    FOR EUROPEAN UNION (EU) USERS: if a dispute arises, we strongly encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a resolution. We will consider reasonable requests to resolve the dispute through alternative dispute resolution procedures, such as arbitration, as an alternative to litigation. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and DJI in the most expedient and cost effective manner, DJI’s strong preference is that you and DJI resolve any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms by binding arbitration, without prejudice to section 8 of the Product Terms.<br>

We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision.

    10.     Dispute Resolution and Arbitration<br>
    FOR EU USERS: Section 10 is not applicable to you.<br>
    10.1   Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and DJI in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and DJI agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND DJI ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.<br>
    10.2   Exceptions. Despite the provisions of Section 10.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.<br>
    FOR AUSTRALIAN USERS: Despite the provisions of Section 10.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) claim in relation to your rights and statutory guarantees in Section 6.1; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.<br>
    10.3   Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and DJI will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting DJI.<br>
    10.4   Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice”). DJI’s address for Notice is: 14th Floor, West Wing, Skyworth Semiconductor Design Building, No.18 Gaoxin South 4th Ave, Nanshan District, Shenzhen, China, 518057. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or DJI may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or DJI must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, DJI will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by DJI in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.<br>
    10.5   Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, DJI will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco County, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse DJI for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<br>
    10.6   No Class Actions. YOU AND DJI AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and DJI agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.<br>
    10.7   Modifications of This Arbitration Provision. If DJI makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to DJI's address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to DJI’s address for Notice, in which case your account with DJI will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.<br>
    10.8   Enforceability. If Section 10.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 10 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 10 (other than, in the latter case, Section 10.6) will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 8 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.<br>
    11.     Contact Information. The Product is offered by SZ DJI Technology Co., Ltd. and its affiliated companies, located at 14th Floor, West Wing, Skyworth Semiconductor Design Building, No.18 Gaoxin South 4th Ave, Nanshan District, Shenzhen, China, 518057.

    You agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English Courts, which means that you may bring a claim to enforce your consumer protection rights in connection with these Terms in a court located in England or in the EU country in which you live.

    EXCEPT FOR OUR LIABILITY TO YOU UNDER THE STATUTORY GUARANTEES DESCRIBED IN SECTION 6.1 (WHICH IS NOT LIMITED OR EXCLUDED):<br>
    IN NO EVENT WILL THE DJI ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE PRODUCT, PRODUCT ACCESSORIES, OR ANY MATERIALS, FLIGHT ENVIRONMENT DATA, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY DJI ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.<br>
    EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 10.4(iii), THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE DJI ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR ANY INABILITY TO USE ANY PORTION OF THE PRODUCT OR OTHERWISE UNDER THESE TERMS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO $100.<br>
    SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
    EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 7.1 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.<br>
    8.  Governing Law and Jurisdiction.<br>
    These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles. If a lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these Terms, then you and DJI agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California for the purpose of litigating any dispute. For avoidance of doubt, Section 10 will not apply to matters that may be taken to the small claims court or matters relating to your rights and statutory guarantees described in Section 6.1.
